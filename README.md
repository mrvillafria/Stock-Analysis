# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we are using Visual Basic for Applications, also known as VBA, to analyze green energy stock data for the years of 2017 and 2018. VBA is a programming language that works with Excel so we can automate tasks and perform complex analyses. Instead of using Excel alone, we can now write scripts to create macros, or sub routines, that will allow us to read and write to cells, process functions, perform calculations, and generate tables and graphs. Throughout Module 2, we created a solution to compare 12 different green energy stocks, but we are looking to refactor the code to run faster. To make the code run more efficiently, we improve the logic of the existing code while keeping the same functionality.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to help Steve and his parents analyze green energy stock data. Although Steveâ€™s parents already invested in Daqo New Energy Corporation, Steve wanted to analyze 11 other green energy stock options to compare their total daily volume and yearly return for 2017 and 2018. While we already had VBA code to read and write out our findings for the 12 green energy stocks, we also refactored the code to accommodate for a larger dataset with more stocks. Steve and his parents will now be able to view data for thousands of stocks and will be more informed on which green energy stock to invest in.

## Results
The analysis performed compares the total daily volumes and year returns for 12 green energy stocks. We initially used our VBA scripting to account for 12 stocks but decided to refactor our code to account for a larger dataset.
